Ball:
- added v_max parameter for x and y
- added player parameter to set direction for data generation
- replaced speed with random speed
-> so the ball position is not sufficient to determine the impact location -> speed vector is needed

Table & Pong:
- removed Table class and united it with Pong
- added functions/variables to play without gui and calculate the impact location
